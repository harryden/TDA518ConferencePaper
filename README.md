# Comparative Analysis of Flutter State Management Solutions

## About
This repository hosts the codebase for the comparative analysis presented in our conference paper "Evaluating State Management Frameworks in Flutter: A Comparative Analysis of Bloc, Riverpod, and GetX". 
It evaluates three prominent state management solutions within the Flutter ecosystem: Bloc, Riverpod, and GetX. Our analysis is grounded on three aspects, including ease of state definition, manipulation, consumption, and overall framework efficiency. 
This work aims to offer valuable insights to Flutter developers, aiding them in selecting the most suitable state management solution for their projects.

The conference paper was part of the course "Professional development for engineers and English" (TDA518) at Chalmers University of Technology, Spring term 2024.
